# My personal chatbot

This project involves creating a chatbot that acts as a digital version of myself. The goal is to have a conversational agent that can answer questions and provide information about my academic background, work experience, hobbies and interests.
## Features

The chatbot will be able to:

    Provide details about my educational history including degrees earned and courses studied
    Summarize my work experience including job titles, responsibilities and accomplishments
    Discuss my skills and areas of expertise
    Talk about my hobbies like music, sports, travel etc.
    Respond to general questions about my personality, likes/dislikes etc.

All this through Scraping through my LinkedIn Profile, reading through my CV and with additional documents for minor facts about myself.

# Implementation

The chatbot is developed using the Python programming language through tools like Streamlit, LangChain and OobaBooga's Textgen-webui.


    1.Data collection - Gathering facts, details and typical conversations from resumes, social profiles etc.
    2.Preprocessing - Cleaning, structuring and formatting the data
    3.Embedding of Data to the LLM Model (Using OpenHermes-2.5-Mistral-7B as base)
    4.Testing - iteratively improving responses through manual testing and adjusting parameters and embeddings
    5.Hosting it on my Personal Website in the near future.



## Challenges

Some potential challenges currently:
    Mimicking conversational style, tone and personality.
    Chat History and conversational flow.
    Running Locally is extremely slow.

Once completed, this project aims to demonstrate my skills in artificial intelligence, natural language processing and machine learning through development of a conversational agent.
